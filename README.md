# ML-Fundamentals-Linear-Regression-From-Scratch
Fundamental Machine Learning project implementing Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares - OLS) from scratch in Python using NumPy. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of the mathematical theory (calculating Alpha and Beta parameters) and the ability to translate core ML concepts into code.
